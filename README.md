# Detecting Clouds in a Starlit Sky

This is the source code to my Part III (4th year) project. It is released under the MIT license (see COPYING). For an overview of the project, see [the writeup](http://bjwebb.co.uk/files/detecting-clouds.pdf).

## Using the Code

Currently there is little documentation of the code. The steps required to process the data as described in my writeup are listed in `all.sh`.
