        Useful to note
(lb) Beware final sidtime minute etc.
    Actually very short and apparently no images in it
Currently finding 'sidtime' by rounding down....
(lb) Sort out them smudges
Investigate whether the Milky Way is acting like a cloud
Look for breaks in lines, and check if sextractor is wrong
Would be nice to know if gnuplots internal format counts leapseconds
    Although, there's only one leapsecond June 2012 in the relevant time period. One second is smaller than the exposure time


        Neatness
Change perline to use slices rather than pk bounds
Clean up hardcoded linevalue generations
Stop using raw sql when it's not neccessary
Use postgres truncate
    actually if not dropping databases, must be carefull to vacuum, reindex and not assume pk=1 is first
Clean up some of the early javascript variable names
Deal with float BSCALE in a nicer way
Fix inconsistency of naming of Line's fields


        ?
Split out importing points from matching them 


        Minor UI
Plot filtered points in a different colour


        Important
Calculate more errors:
    Calculate error bars for perimage values
    For realpoints based on their distance from the relevant sidpoint
